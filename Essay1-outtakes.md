<!-- If you're a real motherfucker you will never stand in front of a mirror, agonizing about the fact that you're "going to be seen" when you go out in pubic. -- People who trust in your character simply, trust in your character. And that's the other thing; I can sniff-out your character by how you're dressed.
        
        
        
        
        Of course, there is dressing decently, and then there is <i> dressing to prove a point to others And if you're guilty ... 

            I don't care if you landed a job that pays $75,000+ a year to be convinced otherwise. I don't care that you or your shitty backyardi-band have been on the come-up. I don't care that you got your degree in your preferred field.
        
        The fact is that you lost your edge, and if your wardrobe is the only thing grounding you in the lies you keep selling yourself-- that you're "so sick" and totally have "something new" to bring to the table-- I hate to break it to you, but you're a jerkoff, my guy.-- "But im so stoked"-- Again, you're a jerkoff.

        <!--If your dog could talk, it would probably tell you that you... also suck. Except me, though. Your dog would think that I'm pretty fucking cool; cooler than you. That bastard knows I have a secret stash of treats that I hide in my room just for him. I went out of my way to buy him, and that boy knows it. And, as your friend, I would be bluntly honest with you if you asked me if I was feeding your dog his doggy treats.   -->
