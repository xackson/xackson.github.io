<h3>Roblox: Where children (and adults) roam</h3>

<h3> Step 1: Statement of Topic</h3>

<p>1) What is the broad issue you are interested in working on? <br><br>The effects of hyper-technologization and its relationship with the parenting habits of Millennials</p>

<p>2) How have you crafted this issue into a narrow question or problem for your capstone?<br><br>
    I wanted to better understand the reasoning behind the existence of "iPad kids" and like phenomena-- are they results of our tech-saturated lifestyles, or are kids as young as 4 years old really asking/using tablets, etc, because Mom and Dad use them at home (and thus, are the parents the result of tech-pioneer-isms?). I see iPad kids in many public places, and given how much younger these children are than the presumed averaged-age smart-device user, I begin to wonder what long-term effects this may have on the child, and how they got here in the first placeâ€” I assume that parents are the ones to have placed these sophisticated computers into their child's hands; and so I wonder: what is the criteria necessary for a parent to hand over their child an iPad/tablet/phone? How much smart-technology does the average Millennial parental-figure handle, and at what specific point in parenthood do they decide that handing over an iPad/tablet/phone is right for their child? In terms of age, how large of a gap is there between Millenials and Gen-Z/Alphas and their first exposure(s) to using cellphones/smart-devices? In our tech-saturated world, Is there a desire/need in Gen-Z/Alpha to move away from a tech-heavy lifestyle? Also, is mass surveillance/data-mining seen as an issue at any point in this, and is surveillance on it's own enough of a problem that we care to remove ourselves from?</p>

<p>2) Using in-text citations to support your claim, explain why this topic is significant (urgent, impactful, etc.)<br><br>
    The issue at hand focuses on children, teens, parents, smart-devices/tablets, and social-media, but I also want to highlight our seemingly unshakeable dependency on current common technologies; Apple Pay means you don't need to carry a wallet; you don't need a watch to check the time; you don't need a digital camera-- your phone shoots over 24 megapixels; you can order dog/cat and human food to your house by tomorrow (or tonight) at the touch of a button; with TikTok you can buy this miniature drone (that was targeted to you using your personal data/scrolling habits) using Apple Pay; parents can track their kids' location to the exact inch using satellite data-- every kind of convenience in the palm of our hands. Now, there are obvious benefits to the conveniences of modern smartphones, like parents being able to supervise their kid's whereabouts, but when do these conveniences become too much, and what habits have we created around them that actually make us fall short in a fundamental, humanistic-sense? In what ways do they blind us to alternative (past) ways of living?</p>
