<h3>Roblox: Where children (and adults) roam</h3>

<h3> Step 1: Statement of Topic</h3>

<p><b>1) What is the broad issue you are interested in working on?</b> <br><br>The effects of hyper-technologization and its relationship with the parenting habits of Millennials</p>

<p><b>2) How have you crafted this issue into a narrow question or problem for your capstone?</b><br><br>
    I wanted to better understand the reasoning behind the existence of "iPad kids" and like phenomena-- are they results of our tech-saturated lifestyles, or are kids as young as 4 years old really asking/using tablets, etc, because Mom and Dad use them at home (and thus, are the parents the result of tech-pioneer-isms?). I see iPad kids in many public places, and given how much younger these children are than the presumed averaged-age smart-device user, I begin to wonder what long-term effects this may have on the child, and how they got here in the first place— I assume that parents are the ones to have placed these sophisticated computers into their child's hands; and so I wonder: what is the criteria necessary for a parent to hand over their child an iPad/tablet/phone? How much smart-technology does the average Millennial parental-figure handle, and at what specific point in parenthood do they decide that handing over an iPad/tablet/phone is right for their child? In terms of age, how large of a gap is there between Millenials and Gen-Z/Alphas and their first exposure(s) to using cellphones/smart-devices? In our tech-saturated world, Is there a desire/need in Gen-Z/Alpha to move away from a tech-heavy lifestyle? Also, is mass surveillance/data-mining seen as an issue at any point in this, and is surveillance on it's own enough of a problem that we care to remove ourselves from?</p>

<p><b>3) Using in-text citations to support your claim, explain why this topic is significant (urgent, impactful, etc.)</b><br><br>
    The issue at hand focuses on children, teens, parents, smart-devices/tablets, and social-media, but I also want to highlight our seemingly unshakeable dependency on current common technologies; Apple Pay means you don't need to carry a wallet; you don't need a watch to check the time; you don't need a digital camera-- your phone shoots over 24 megapixels; you can order dog/cat and human food to your house by tomorrow (or tonight) at the touch of a button; with TikTok you can buy this miniature drone (that was targeted to you using your personal data/scrolling habits) using Apple Pay; parents can track their kids' location to the exact inch using satellite data-- every kind of convenience in the palm of our hands. Now, there are obvious benefits to the conveniences of modern smartphones, like parents being able to supervise their kid's whereabouts, but when do these conveniences become too much, and what habits have we created around them that actually make us fall short in a fundamental, humanistic-sense? In what ways do they blind us to alternative (past) ways of living?</p>

<p><b>4)  Using in-text citations to support your claim, explain how this topic is relevant to each of your focus disciplines.</b><br><br>
It is clear that since 2020 the world has slowly recognized the clutches that social media has on people, but also a common lack of self-control when it comes to limiting ourselves to social media. Those who consume/use their smart-devices in both unhealthy and even unhealthy fashions incidentally hand over mountains of usage data to Major Providers (ie. Verizon, Apple) who use said data to market us hyper-personalized experiences and advertisements; and by "us" I especially mean young children/teens. This problem is important because as we enter 2025, it means that there will be more and more parents that will foist their children/teens into becoming cell/smart-device users, and the negative psycho/sociological habits that are influenced by the exposure to smart-devices will increase if there is not another solution that will steer us toward being more responsible smart-device users. In a PEW Research study, it was noted that many children in the study noted "that getting a cell phone was their parents’ idea, not their own" (Chapter Three: Attitudes Towards Cellphones). This is an important notion behind the growing usage of cellphone/social-media in children because one of the primary motives is because "94% of parents and 93% of those ages 12-17 agreed with the statement: “I feel safer because I can always use my cell phone to get help" (Chapter Three: Attitudes Toward Cellphones). Knowing that cellphones enable permanent connections to family and/or facilitate one of mankind's basic need for safety, might one of the unintended long-term consequences of being permanently connected to family/friends result in cellphone over-reliance or borderline addiction? Now, not all families are perfect, but “in a longitudinal study, they (Ko) found that adolescents who do not live with their mother or father, who are not cared for by their parents, who experience frequent parent-adolescent conflict, or who experience frequent conflict within their family are more likely to become addicted to the internet (Ko et al.). This finding reinforces the importance of family influence on children and their inclination to internet usage.</p>

<p><b>5) Citing specific details (names of classes you’ve taken, skills you have developed, extracurricular activities you’ve participated in) explain how your personal training and/or background make you a good fit for this topic.</b><br><br>
    My topic question and my focus disciplines (Venture Creation, Product Innovation, and Entrepreneurship) are intimately related to the topic question due to the nature and relevance of technology, entrepreneurial problem solving, and capitalistic ventures. From the top-down, UI/UX design is at the center of the issue for many obvious reasons: intuitive and alluring design that is made to keep users addicted to their devices/apps. Product Innovation due to the ever-evolving needs of users. And finally Entrepreneurship, due to the need of independent creators to stir the pot that is currently our modern understanding of capitalistic venture(s). </p>
