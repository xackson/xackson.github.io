    <h3 class="selected"> About This Page </h3>

<p class="selected"> I built myself this website so I wouldn't need to use Twitter, Tumblr, or Threads in order to worry about my thoughts never being heard. Plus, I really dislike the constant limitations imposed by other websites. <br> <br>

    <b>Let it be known: the words that are printed here are written by stream-of-consciousness; a reflection of the synaptic mindpower traveling from my brain and into my keyboard. </b> <br> <br>

    Among other things I want to bring into this space, this is a place for me to write. Many of these entries will come across as distasteful, judgemental, and downright hurtful. When I am writing, I am tackling the demons that plague mine and (dare I say, what seems like, evidently) <b>our</b> minds; staring at insecurties, projections, and toxcicities right in their stupid faces and enabling them, so as to destroy them for good. <br> <br> 
    
    If you leave judgement at the door, some things written might be found as funny, but that is not my intention. I'm not a salty dog, or a hater. I am no better (or worse) than you. I just want to be clear: this is entirely for my personal entertainment. <br> <br>

    I implore anyone, at anytime, no matter what the occasion, to message me. Short or long, I don't mind. I have profound amounts of love in my heart for every person that has come/gone from my life. I am accessible, yet clearly afraid.

    <p class="aside"> If you feel like you really know yourself: great. But honestly, like a lot of people, you probably suck. Someone has had to have told you by now, and if they haven't, they weren't being honest with you. That, or they were too naive, or "too kind" not to tell you. </p> 

    <p class = "aside"> A good friend is nice to you like a good dog is loyal, except, a truly loyal friend is honest with you, and dogs can't convey honesty. And I bet if your dog could talk, it too would probably tell you that you fucking suck. -- No, I don't hate to break it to you. In fact, I take great pleasure in having the privilege to tell you. If you want me to stop, just say so-- You do? Well, I don't care. -- By the way, I shouldn't have to be the one to tell you this, but you can't wear the most complex, "hardcore-looking" shirts/sweaters <i>and</i> look like there is a complete fucking pussy underneath all of those oversized garments.-- I dont fucking care that you can "dress the part"-- Only jerkoffs convince themselves that they need to "dress the part" to fit in anywhere.-- I <i>know</i> your fraudulent ass stood in the mirror for at least 10 minutes before convincing yourself that "no one on the street is going to question my credentials in my Sanguisugabogg hoodie"-- Yes, <i>I am</i>, because I see right through you, you coward. -- So don't you dare look at me in the 7/11 the way you are because I'm not repping the darkest, blackest, "XAVLEGBMAOFFFASSSS"-ass graphic on my body. I'm clad in blue jeans and a Puma hoodie because my shit is so tight that I've gone full circle. I am far from being fucking worried about being perceived as a "lesser than" by someone who is clearly worried about being considered "valid" based on what/which band is on their shirt. And considering the fact that you went the distance to make it clear that you're the "hardest guy in the room", it couldn't be more obvious that you quiver in fear about not being perceived as such. Oh, and nice tattoos, that I can clearly see on your arms. Did you make sure it was in juuust the right spot so people could see it? What if I told you that my fucking stomach has more tattoos than both your left and right arms combined. Do I give a fuck who sees? Fuck no-- I'm not a thumb-sucking attention whore who needs to be validated by complete strangers, you dimwit, you jangaloon. You know who sees my tattoos, bro? Your fuckin' mom.
    
    </p>
        
        
        <!-- If you're a real motherfucker you will never stand in front of a mirror, agonizing about the fact that you're "going to be seen" when you go out in pubic. -- People who trust in your character simply, trust in your character. And that's the other thing; I can sniff-out your character by how you're dressed.
        
        
        
        
        Of course, there is dressing decently, and then there is <i> dressing to prove a point to others And if you're guilty ... 

            I don't care if you landed a job that pays $75,000+ a year to be convinced otherwise. I don't care that you or your shitty backyardi-band have been on the come-up. I don't care that you got your degree in your preferred field.
        
        The fact is that you lost your edge, and if your wardrobe is the only thing grounding you in the lies you keep selling yourself-- that you're "so sick" and totally have "something new" to bring to the table-- I hate to break it to you, but you're a jerkoff, my guy.-- "But im so stoked"-- Again, you're a jerkoff.

        <!--If your dog could talk, it would probably tell you that you... also suck. Except me, though. Your dog would think that I'm pretty fucking cool; cooler than you. That bastard knows I have a secret stash of treats that I hide in my room just for him. I went out of my way to buy him, and that boy knows it. And, as your friend, I would be bluntly honest with you if you asked me if I was feeding your dog his doggy treats.   -->
