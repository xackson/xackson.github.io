    <h3> Welcome </h3>
    

<p class="selected"> 

    Hello. My name is Jackson Kindel. If you're reading this, then thank you for taking the time to visit. 
    I built myself this website to act as an extension of myself; a playground for my antics both creative and technical. For now, this site will act as both a journal to write in, and a place for me to experiment with web-design. </p>

    <p class="selected"> 
        I have this weird prediction that, after social media permeates every aspect of life, there will come a regression in terms of how we care to access each other online-- Twitter? A cesspool. Instagram? Best case, it lives until it turns into LinkedIn. ... LinkedIn? Straight in the garbage-- and then same with Instagram. By the time we've realized that social media is the energy-sucking nonsense that we've all known it to be, we will come full circle back to good ol' HTML and CSS. Evolution, baby. </p>

    <p class ="selected"> ... Anyways if/when that time comes, your true online presence will become the content that you have built with your own two hands-- I want to land on your silly little website and remember you forever. I want to wonder why your color pallette matches your aesthetic; I want to see the photos that are the most important to you, and why you felt so compelled to lay them out the way you did; I want to see your essays, whether satirical, philosophical, or downright ordinary. I want to see how you fluorish in the Wild West 3.0 of internet. </p>
    <p class="selected"> Anyways, the point I'm grasping at is that tech companies took it upon themselves to "give us a platform" meanwhile robbing us of the actual experience of the internet. A curated instagram page? No thanks. A highly reactive, jQuery-saturated, parallax-induced-dizziness of a landing page? <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/"> Again, no thank you. </a>  </p>

    <h3> content warning </h3>

    <p class="selected"> Let it be known: the words that I journal here are written by stream-of-consciousness; a reflection of the synaptic mindpower traveling from my brain and into my keyboard. </p>

    <p class="selected"> Some of the themes will come across as judgemental, vile, distasteful, and/or downright hurtful. While I will try to make some of the content as friendly as possible, I feel like I have to say that from the bottom of my heart: no, I'm not attacking you. When I write, I'm tackling demons that plague mine and (dare I say what seems like) our minds; staring at insecurties, projections, and toxicities right in their stupid faces and enabling them, so as to destroy them for good. My inspiration comes from within, and I'm here to let that dragon run amok. </p> 
    
    <p class="selected"> My writing philosophy is that I don't write with the intention that anything I make will be read. I think it would be disingenuous of me if I did. If you leave judgement at the door, some things written might be found as "funny", but that is not my intention (or maybe it is. you be the judge). I'm not a hater, or some salty dog. I am no better (or worse) than you. I just need to be clear: this is entirely for my personal entertainment. </p>
    
    <p class="selected">
    I implore anyone, at anytime, no matter what the occasion, to message me. Short or long, I don't mind. I have profound amounts of love in my heart for any person that has come/gone or is currently in my life. I am accessible, yet clearly afraid, excited, even... </p>

    <h3>Posercore (satire)</h3>
    
    

    <p class = "aside"> A good friend is nice to you like a good dog is loyal. Except, a truly loyal friend is honest with you, and since dogs cannot convey honesty, I'll be honest with you-- I would bet that if your dog could talk, it would probably tell you that you f*cking suck. No, I don't hate to break it to you. In fact I take great pleasure in having the privilege to break it to you-- Just kidding-- I'M KIDDING, relax. But if you want me to stop, just say so... -- Oh, I should? Well, I don't care.  <br> <br>
        
        -- I don't want to be the one that has to tell you this, but you can't wear the most complex, "hardcore-looking" shirts/sweaters <i>and</i> expect me to think that there isn't a gigantic, faint-of-heart, misanthropic, almost-but-not-really-a-nihilist (pussy) underneath all of those oversized garments-- "But, I'm so stoked. I'm the prophet of doom, the transmitter of satanic hymns. You can't touch me." -- No, see... I can, and you're a jerkoff; it sends the same message as guys who drive lifted diesel trucks: you're overcompensating. <br> <br>
        
        I can't tell what makes me feel worse for you; that expecting some poor soul with half of a brain to think that your peculiar appearance is your silver-lining as a person, or that the reality of your pathetically-curated getup is that the only people you're trying to "woo" are people from your suburban hometown (normies, as you call them), and that group of goth girls at the bar (who are gay and smarter than you, but you've ruled that out in your favor). -- Oh, you dress like that because you want to? Carry on, then. <br> <br>
        
        -- But really, I dont care that you can "dress the part"-- only candidates for the "jerkoff of the year" award convince themselves that they have to dress "the part". I would bet that your fraudulent ass stood in the mirror for 20 minutes trying to convincing yourself that "no one on the street is going to question my credentials in my Sanguisugabogg hoodie"-- Yes, I will, because I can see right through you, you coward. Your need to be perceived as post-everything-all-of-the-time is fueled by the lack of courage you have in your heart. You spend countless hours making sure that you're seen as different, but your soul is suffering from the price of what you think that means.  <br> <br>
        
        One more thing-- don't you dare look at me in the 7/11 the way you are because I'm not repping the darkest, blackest, most heart-wrenching emoviolence band on my body. I'm clad in blue jeans and a Puma hoodie because my finesse is so imperceptible that I've already gone full circle-- I don't need to explain myself to you. I am <i>far</i> from being worried about being perceived as a "lesser than" by someone who is clearly worried about being considered "valid" or "legitimate" based on what/which band is on their clothing. And, considering the fact that you went the distance to make it clear that you're the "hardest person in the room", it couldn't be more obvious that you quiver in fear about not being perceived as such. Oh, and nice tattoos, that I can clearly see on your arms. Did you make sure they were all in juuust the right spot so people could see them? What if I told you that my stomach has more tattoos than both of your left and right arms combined? Do I give a shit who sees? No-- that's my point. I'm not a thumb-sucking attention whore who needs to be validated by complete strangers. You dimwit, you jangaloon. You know who sees my tattoos, bro?<br> Your mom.

<p class ="aside">I'm the best ever. I'm the most brutal and vicious and most ruthless champion there's ever been, there's no one can stop me. Lennox is a conqueror? No, I'm Alexander—he's no Alexander. I'm the best ever. There's never been anybody as ruthless. I'm Sonny Liston, I'm Jack Dempsey, there's no one like—I'm from their cloth. There's no one that can match me. My style is impetuous, my defense is impregnable, and I'm just ferocious. I want your heart, I want to eat his children. Praise be to Allah. <br>

            How can I stray from this lingering memory; a celestial mass occupying neuropaths, denying me solace. <br> <br>
            
            A vagrant projectionist, behind my eyelids; feeding a cut of some desolate recollection. <br> <br>
            Inheriting the sorrow that reaps in the mist; but teeth bite down on your face. <br> <br>
            Weary and dull, into monotony. Smell the wood of your rotting home.
