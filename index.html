    <h3> Greetings </h3>

    <p class="selected"> Greetings, friend. My name is Jack Kindel.  I've built this website to act as a playground and a portfolio for my creative and technical antics. I believe one simple notion, and that is: after social media has invaded every inch of our lives, there will come a regression in terms of how we care to access each other online. This is why I am building a website.


    
    <p class="selected"> Built with my own two hands, this website is running on GitHub, for free(mium), using GitHub Pages. It ain't much, but it's mine and it's working for now. </p>

    <h3>content advisory</h3>
    <h5> ** this section needs to be placed elsewhere **</h5>


    <p class="selected"> Some of the themes written will come across as distasteful, hurtful, judgemental, juvenile, neurotic, visciously unhinged, and/or downright vile-- straight from the Id, south of the Ego... <br><br> I've inscribed the words <b>"as above, so below"</b> at the top of the page to indicate the polarities of self-awareness that I believe to be absolutely mandatory when writing at such high and low altitudes. <br> <br>Therefore, written content will be written "so below", and complimented with a response "as above". </p>

    <p class="selected"> I will try to make some of the content as "friendly" as can be, but I'm afraid that might not be possible.<br><br> When I write, I'm maneuvering demons that plague my mind; staring at insecurties, projections, and toxicities right in their stupid faces and enabling them, so as to destroy them for good. It's fun.

<p class ="aside">I'm the best ever. I'm the most brutal and vicious and most ruthless champion there's ever been, there's no one can stop me. Lennox is a conqueror? No, I'm Alexander—he's no Alexander. I'm the best ever. There's never been anybody as ruthless. I'm Sonny Liston, I'm Jack Dempsey, there's no one like—I'm from their cloth. There's no one that can match me. My style is impetuous, my defense is impregnable, and I'm just ferocious. I want your heart, I want to eat his children. Praise be to Allah. <br>
