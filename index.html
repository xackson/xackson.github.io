    <h3> Read Before Continuing </h3>

<p class="selected"> I built myself this website so I wouldn't need to use Twitter, Tumblr, or Threads in order to worry about my thoughts never being heard. Plus, I don't really care if my Tweets are "bangin" or not. Sites like those aren't meant for my particular prowess.  <br> <br>

    <b>Let it be known: the words printed here are written by stream-of-consciousness; a reflection of the synaptic mindpower traveling from my brain and into my keyboard. </b> <br> <br>

    Among other things I want to bring into this space, this is a place for me to write (for now). Many of the themes here will come across as judgemental, disgustingly vile, distasteful, and downright hurtful. When I write, I'm tackling demons that plague mine and (dare I say, what seems like) our minds; staring at insecurties, projections, and toxicities right in their stupid faces and enabling them, so as to destroy them for good. <br> <br> 
    
    My writing philosophy is that I don't write with the intention that anything here will be read. If I did, it would be incredibly disingenuous of me. If you leave judgement at the door, some things written might be found as "funny", but that is not my intention. I'm not a salty dog, or a hater. I am no better (or worse) than you. I just need to be clear: this is entirely for my personal entertainment. <br> <br>

    I implore anyone, at anytime, no matter what the occasion, to message me. Short or long, I don't mind. I have profound amounts of love in my heart for any person that has come/gone or is currently in my life. I am accessible, yet clearly afraid.

<aside> <h3> Full Circle </h3>
    
    

    <p class = "aside"> A good friend is nice to you like a good dog is loyal, except, a truly loyal friend is honest with you, and dogs can't convey honesty. And I bet if your dog could talk, it would probably tell you that you fucking suck. -- No, I don't hate to break it to you. In fact, I take great pleasure in having the privilege to tell you. If you want me to stop, just say so-- You do? Well, I don't care. -- By the way, I shouldn't have to be the one to tell you this, but you can't wear the most complex, "hardcore-looking" shirts/sweaters <i>and</i> look like there is a complete fucking pussy underneath all of those oversized garments.-- I dont fucking care that you can "dress the part"-- Only jerkoffs convince themselves that they need to "dress the part" to fit in anywhere.-- I <i>know</i> your fraudulent ass stood in the mirror for at least 10 minutes before convincing yourself that "no one on the street is going to question my credentials in my Sanguisugabogg hoodie"-- Yes, <i>I will</i>, because I can see right through you, you coward. -- So don't you dare look at me in the 7/11 the way you are because I'm not repping the darkest, blackest, "XAVLEGBMAOFFFASSSS"-ass graphic on my body. I'm clad in blue jeans and a Puma hoodie because my shit is so tight that I've gone full circle. I am far from being fucking worried about being perceived as a "lesser than" by someone who is clearly worried about being considered "valid" based on what/which band is on their shirt. And considering the fact that you went the distance to make it clear that you're the "hardest guy in the room", it couldn't be more obvious that you quiver in fear about not being perceived as such. Oh, and nice tattoos, that I can clearly see on your arms. Did you make sure it was in juuust the right spot so people could see it? What if I told you that my fucking stomach has more tattoos than both your left and right arms combined. Do I give a fuck who sees? Fuck no-- That's my point. I'm not a thumb-sucking attention whore who needs to be validated by complete strangers, you dimwit, you jangaloon. You know who sees my tattoos, bro? Your fuckin' mom.

<p class ="aside">I'm the best ever. I'm the most brutal and vicious and most ruthless champion there's ever been, there's no one can stop me. Lennox is a conqueror? No, I'm Alexander—he's no Alexander. I'm the best ever. There's never been anybody as ruthless. I'm Sonny Liston, I'm Jack Dempsey, there's no one like—I'm from their cloth. There's no one that can match me. My style is impetuous, my defense is impregnable, and I'm just ferocious. I want your heart, I want to eat his children. Praise be to Allah. <br>

            How can I stray from this lingering memory; a celestial mass occupying neuropaths, denying me solace. <br> <br>
            
            A vagrant projectionist, behind my eyelids; feeding a cut of some desolate recollection. <br> <br>
            Inheriting the sorrow that reaps in the mist; but teeth bite down on your face. <br> <br>
            Weary and dull, into monotony. Smell the wood of your rotting home.
