<aside> <h1 class="selected"> You Probably Suck </h1>
    
    <p class="aside"> Honestly, like most people, you probably suck. Someone had to tell you by now, and if they haven't, then they weren't being honest with you. --  A good friend is nice to you like a good dog is loyal to you, but a <i>loyal</i> friend is honest with you (even if they might be wrong). And, if your dog could talk and had the chance to be honest with you, it would probably tell you that you fucking suck. Hate to break it to you. <br>

        <!--If your dog could talk, it would probably tell you that you... also suck. Except me, though. Your dog would think that I'm pretty fucking cool; cooler than you. That bastard knows I have a secret stash of treats that I hide in my room just for him. I went out of my way to buy him, and that boy knows it. And, as your friend, I would be bluntly honest with you if you asked me if I was feeding your dog his doggy treats.   -->
