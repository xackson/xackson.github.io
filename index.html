    <h3> About This Page </h3>

<p class="selected"> I am simply jestering; prodding; joking. I have always liked to write, and have never had a place to do it before. I built myself a website so I wouldn't have to use Twitter or Tumblr or Threads in order to worry about my thoughts never being heard. What is said here is might scare you, but simply I enjoy writing, especially in the fashion of a salty dog.  </p>

<aside> <h3 class="selected"> You (Might) Suck </h3>
    
    <p class="aside"> And if you know yourself, then: great. But honestly, like a lot of people, you probably suck. Someone has had to have told you by now, and if they haven't, they weren't being honest with you. That, or they were too naive, or "too kind" not to tell you. </p> 

    <p class = "aside"> A good friend is nice to you like a good dog is loyal, except, a truly loyal friend is honest with you, and dogs can't convey honesty. And I bet if your dog could talk, it too would probably tell you that you fucking suck. -- No, I don't hate to break it to you. In fact, I take great pleasure in having the privilege to tell you. If you want me to stop, just say so. -- Oh, you do? Alright. Well, I don't care. -- By the way, I shouldn't have to be the one to tell you this, but you can't wear the most complex, "hardcore-looking" shirts/sweaters <i>and</i> look like there is a complete fucking pussy underneath all of those oversized garments. -- I dont fucking care that you can "dress the part". Only jerkoffs convince themselves that they need to "dress the part". -- I <i>know</i> your fraudulent ass stood in the mirror for at least 10 minutes before convincing yourself that "no one on the street is going to question my credentials in my Sanguisugabogg hoodie" -- Yes, <i>I am</i>, and I see right through you. -- If you're a real motherfucker, you will never stand in front of a mirror, agonizing about the fact that you're "going to be seen" when you go out in pubic. -- People who trust in your character simply, trust in your character. Do you think I give a shit about how I dress when I go to hang out with my friends? You would think so. Of course, there is dressing decently, and then there is <i> dressing to prove a point to others</i>. And if you're guilty 
         
    </p>
        
        
        I don't care if you landed a job that pays $75,000+ a year to be convinced otherwise. The fact is that you lost your edge, and if your wardrobe is the only thing grounding you in the lies you keep selling yourself-- that you're "so sick" and totally have "something new" to bring to the table. -- I hate to break it to you, but you're a jerkoff, my guy. -- "But im so stoked" -- Again, you're a jerkoff. </p>

        <!--If your dog could talk, it would probably tell you that you... also suck. Except me, though. Your dog would think that I'm pretty fucking cool; cooler than you. That bastard knows I have a secret stash of treats that I hide in my room just for him. I went out of my way to buy him, and that boy knows it. And, as your friend, I would be bluntly honest with you if you asked me if I was feeding your dog his doggy treats.   -->
