    <h3>Greetings</h3>

    <p class="selected">and welcome. My name is Jack. This is a playground/portfolio for my creative and professional antics. You can take a look around, but there isn't much going on just yet. <p>

        <p class="selected"> Using GitHub Pages, I am testing the flexibility and interconnectivity of static webpages; I'm building it unil the goddamn wheels fall off.</p>

    <h3>content advisory</h3>
    <h5> ** this section needs to be placed elsewhere **</h5>


    <p class="selected"> Some of the themes written will come across as distasteful, hurtful, judgemental, juvenile, neurotic, visciously unhinged, and/or downright vile-- straight from the Id, south of the Ego... <br><br> I've inscribed the words <b>"as above, so below"</b> at the top of the page to indicate the polarities of self-awareness that I believe to be absolutely mandatory when writing at such high and low altitudes. <br> <br>Therefore, written content will be written "so below", and complimented with a response "as above". </p>

    <p class="selected"> I will try to make some of the content as "friendly" as can be, but I'm afraid that might not be possible.<br><br> When I write, I'm maneuvering demons that plague my mind; staring at insecurties, projections, and toxicities right in their stupid faces and enabling them, so as to destroy them for good. It's fun.
