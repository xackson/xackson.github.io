<div class="subparagraph"> 
    
    

<p class="selected"> If you're reading this, then thank you for taking the time to visit. My name is Jack Kindel.  I've built this website to act as a temporary portfolio, as well as a playground for my  creative and technical antics. </p>

<p class="selected"> We are temporarily up and running</p>

<div class="subparagraph"> 


    
<button onClick="dropdown()" class="dropbtn"> Why? </button>
    <p class="selected"> I have this strange prediction that after social media permeates every inch of life, there will come a regression in terms of how we care to access each other online, if we still even care at all -- this is where I care to be seen for the time being. <br> <br> By the time we've realized that social media is the energy-sucking nonsense that we've all known it to be, I don't see how we don't end up circling back to static webpages. <br> <br>I could be wrong, though. Who really cares?</p>

    <p class ="selected"> Anyways, my point is that if/when that time comes, I believe that your true online presence will become the content that you have built with your own two hands. </p>

<div class="subparagraph"> 

    <h3 class="warning">content advisory</h3>
    <h5> ** this section needs to be placed elsewhere **</h5>


    <p class="selected"> Some of the themes written will come across as distasteful, hurtful, judgemental, juvenile, neurotic, visciously unhinged, and/or downright vile-- straight from the Id, south of the Ego... <br><br> I've inscribed the words <b>"as above, so below"</b> at the top of the page to indicate the polarities of self-awareness that I believe to be absolutely mandatory when writing at such high and low altitudes. <br> <br>Therefore, written content will be written "so below", and complimented with a response "as above". </p>

    <p class="selected"> I will try to make some of the content as "friendly" as can be, but I'm afraid that might not be possible.<br><br> When I write, I'm maneuvering demons that plague my mind; staring at insecurties, projections, and toxicities right in their stupid faces and enabling them, so as to destroy them for good. <br> <br> Besides, writing all of this is spiritually exhausting. Do you really think I spend my waking hours worrying about the nonsense you're about to encounter? No sir'ee or ma'am, no xe or xem, that's why I come here to spill my guts out. <br><br> If you know me personally, you know that i'm a pretty laid back person. So of course, upon reading, things will come across as quite jarring. 
    </p> 

    <p class="divider"> --- --- --- </p>

    <p class="selected"> The words that I journal are written by stream-of-consciousness; a reflection of the synaptic mindpower traveling between my brain and the keyboard. My inspiration comes from within, and I'm here to let that dragon run amok.<br><br> I'll try and keep it classy, though. I do strive for elegance. </p>
    
    <p class="selected"> My writing philosophy is that I don't write with the intention that anything I make will be read. I think it would be disingenuous of me if I did. The irony of editing, however, renders that statement untrue-- no one wants to read a sloppy writeup, and I suppose I can't keep everything a secret forever. </p>
    
    <p class="selected"> I'm open to any and all criticisms, comments (I'm looking to add a comment section in the future)... but understand that assessing the crime of pigeon-holing is a waste of our time, as the entire concept of AA:SB is to assess the flaws (and hypocrisies) of my own peevish criticisms. I implore anyone, anytime, no matter what the occasion, to message me. I am accessible, and I don't bite, unless you bite first. ;) </p>

    <p class ="selected"> Lastly, if you leave judgement at the door some things might be found as "funny", but that is not my focus, or my intention (maybe it is, you decide). I'm not your hater, or some salty dog. I'm a lover, and a fighter. I am no better (or worse) than you. <b>I just need to be clear: this is entirely for my personal entertainment. </b> </p>

<p class ="aside">I'm the best ever. I'm the most brutal and vicious and most ruthless champion there's ever been, there's no one can stop me. Lennox is a conqueror? No, I'm Alexander—he's no Alexander. I'm the best ever. There's never been anybody as ruthless. I'm Sonny Liston, I'm Jack Dempsey, there's no one like—I'm from their cloth. There's no one that can match me. My style is impetuous, my defense is impregnable, and I'm just ferocious. I want your heart, I want to eat his children. Praise be to Allah. <br>
