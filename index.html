    <p class="aside"> Welcome to my GitHub Page. This is an impromptu project portfolio that I will be expanding upon in the coming weeks/months. <br><br>
        I am currently figuring the ins and outs of GitHub pages (and other extensions of it) in order to build a personal portfolio of arts/design) of every dimension, including music, and essays. <br> <br>

        Because I am building it completely from scratch, you will find that my site looks absolutely f*cked. I am currently working on formatting the site to work on mobile, as all the code is formatted for computers only (it looks normal on a computer). 
        
        I am multi-disciplinarian who does not fit into one segment of life. I want this website to be a place where I can pour myself out to everyone, and, as a secondary goal, show off a bit of my technical knowledge...  </p>

<p class="aboutme"> My name is <span class="jackson"> Jackson Kindel </span> (he/him). I go by both <span class="jackson"> "Jack"</span> and <span class="jackson"> "Jackson" </span> :) </p>

<p class="aboutme"> Now 25 years of age, I have since been a student at VCU since I was 19. I took a 3-semester hiatus after my freshman year to reevaluate my academic goals. 
    <br><br> 
    In that time, I was a landscaper and a cellphone sales representative while living in Northern Virginia, and then a waiter working on Snowshoe Mountain in Slatyfork, West Virginia. I have since been Ubering/DoorDashing like every other schmuck with a cellphone, and occasionally working as a line cook at a variety of restaurants in Richmond VA (that will go unnamed because BOH work is the chaos-incarnate).  </p>

    <h3 class="selected"> 5 Things About Me </h3>
<ol>
    <li> I am passionate about music. I taught myself guitar from the age of 10 or 11, and have been playing ever since. I played in two bands in high school, performed with a live band/ensemble for a theatrical production of <i>"Hair! The Musical"</i> at the end of my senior year in high school, and currently play loosely with a group of friends in other friends' livingrooms and backyards. </li>
    <br>
    <li> I consider myself to be a pretty athletic person, but skateboarding is my athletic pursuit of choice. I had a small part in a skateboarding video premier at Grace Street Theater in Winter 2022. </li>
    <br>
    <li> I love history, geology, and astronomy. I enjoy unearthing and collecting cool rocks. I have a moderately-nice telescope that I love to use on nights when the moon is bright, or when a certain planet is visible in the sky. I also collect trading cards; vintage cigarette cards, baseball, basketball, and Yu-gi-ho cards. Pokemon is dead, and you heard it here. </li>
    <br>
    <li> I love cooking on my cast-iron skillet. It has serviced me for the last 5 years, and I take pride in maintaining it all this time. </li>
    <br>
    <li> My music taste is incredibly broad and obscure; not consistent in the slightest. I am hoping to begin a temporary career in radio as a DJ at WRIR 97.3 FM this fall/winter.
    </li>
</ol>
