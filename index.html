    <p class="aside"> Welcome to my GitHub Page. This is an impromptu project-portfolio that I will be expanding upon in the coming weeks/months. <br> <br>

        Mind the cringe: the bulk of this site was used for a little webdev project for in of my past classes. <br>
        
        I am currently figuring the ins and outs of GitHub pages (and other extensions of it) in order to build a personal portfolio of arts/design of every dimension, including music, and essays. <br> <br>

        Because I am building it completely from scratch, you will find that the site looks absolutely f*cked. <br> <br> 
        
        I am actively working on formatting the site to work on mobile, as all the code was originally formatted for computers only. <br> <br>
        
        I am a student of many disciplines; I have grown up knowing that I am not destined to fit within just one segment of this life. <br> <br> 
        
        This website will be a place where I can pour myself out to everyone, as well as a place to show off bits of my technical knowledge...  </p>

<p class="aboutme"> My name is <span class="jackson"> Jackson Kindel </span> (he/him). I go by both <span class="jackson"> "Jack"</span> and <span class="jackson"> "Jackson" </span> </p>

<p class="aboutme"> Now 25 years of age, I have since been a student at VCU since I was 19. I took a 3-semester hiatus after my freshman year to reevaluate my academic goals. 
    <br><br> 
    During my time away, I was a landscaper and a cellphone sales representative while living in Northern Virginia, and then a waiter working on Snowshoe Mountain in Slatyfork, West Virginia.  </p>

    <h3 class="selected"> 5 Things About Me </h3>
<ol>
    <li> I am passionate about music. I picked up the guitar at age 10 or 11 and have played ever since. I played in two bands in high school, and performed with a live band/ensemble for a theatrical production of <i>"Hair! The Musical"</i> at the end of my senior year in high school. <b> I am currently seeking mildly-experienced musical partners in Richmond, Virginia, who want to pursue alternative/hardcore/black-metal/shoegaze/post-rock etc projects. </b>   </li>
    
    <br>
    <li> I like skateboarding but I don't film nearly as much as I should (I feel like Max Palmer, sometimes...). I had a small line in a skateboarding video premier at Grace Street Theater in Winter 2022. </li>
    <br>
    <li> I love geology and astronomy. I enjoy unearthing and collecting cool rocks. I have a moderately-nice telescope that I love to use on nights when the moon is bright, or when a certain planet is visible in the sky. I also collect trading cards; vintage cigarette cards, baseball, basketball, Magic: The Gathering, and Yu-gi-ho cards. </li>
    <br>
    <li> I fucking love cooking on my cast-iron skillet. </li>
    <br>
    <li> My music taste is incredibly broad and obscure; not consistent in the slightest. I am hoping to begin a temporary career in radio as a DJ at WRIR 97.3 FM this fall/winter.
    </li>
</ol>
