<aside> <h3 class="selected"> You Probably Suck </h2>
    
    <p class="aside"> Honestly, like most people, you probably suck. Someone had to tell you by now, and if they haven't, they weren't being honest with you. I don't care if you're being paid $75,000+/- a year to be convinced otherwise. The fact is is that you lost your edge and your wardrobe is the only thing grounding you in the lies you keep selling yourself-- that you're "so sick" and totally have "something new" to bring to the table. -- You're a jerkoff, my guy. -- "But im so stoked" -- Again, you're a jerkoff. </p>
        
        <p class = "aside"> A good friend is nice to you like a good dog is loyal, except, a loyal friend is honest with you, and dogs can't convey honesty. But I bet if your dog could talk and had the chance to be honest with you, it too would probably tell you that you fucking suck. -- No, I don't hate to break it to you. In fact, I take great pleasure in having the privilege to tell you. If you want me to stop, just say so. -- Oh, you don't? Alright. Well, I shouldn't have to be the one to tell you this, but you can't wear the most complex, "hardcore-looking" shirts/sweaters <i>and</i> look like there is a complete fucking pussy underneath all of those oversized garments.  -- I dont fucking care that you can dress the part. <b>Only jerkoffs convince themselves that they need to "dress the part"</b>. -- I <i> know </i> your fraudulent ass stood in the mirror for at least 10 minutes before convincing yourself that "no one on the street is going to question my credentials in my Sanguisugabogg hoodie" -- Yes, <i>I am</i>, and I see right through you. --

        <!--If your dog could talk, it would probably tell you that you... also suck. Except me, though. Your dog would think that I'm pretty fucking cool; cooler than you. That bastard knows I have a secret stash of treats that I hide in my room just for him. I went out of my way to buy him, and that boy knows it. And, as your friend, I would be bluntly honest with you if you asked me if I was feeding your dog his doggy treats.   -->
