    <p class="aside"> I am taking this class to get my certificate in Computer Sciences, but really I am here because I want to enhance the skills I already have, so as to have a better understanding of personal/professional relationship with building web applications. <br> <br>
        
        My dream job is to work at a sports merchandising company of some sort. I am interested in being a project manager/director for sports merchandising ventures. This could mean working with companies like Fanatics, Redbull, and/or Apparel/Sneaker Brands. </p>

<p class="aboutme"> My name is <span class="jackson">Jackson Kindel </span> (he/him). I go by both <span class="jackson">"Jack"</span> and <span class="jackson">"Jackson" </span> :) </p>

<p class="aboutme">Soon to be 25 years of age, I have been a student at VCU since I was 19. I took a 3-semester hiatus (the maximum that VCU allows) after my freshman year, taking some time off to reevaluate my academic goals. 
    <br><br> 
    In that time, I was a landscaper and a cellphone sales representative while living in Northern Virginia, and then a waiter working on Snowshoe Mountain in Slatyfork, West Virginia. </p>

<p class="aboutme"> In the Fall of 2019 when I returned to VCU, I (regrettably) <i>only</i> took 2 classes. Then, COVID-19 hit us like a freight train. Between COVID-19 and today, life seems to have flown by. I am happy with my major (Interdisciplinary Studies with a focus on UI/UX design), but lately, have been feeling sort of "trapped" in college while I look for new jobs. </p>

    <h3 class="selected"> 5 Things About Me </h3>
<ol>
    <li> I am passionate about music. I taught myself guitar from the age of 10 or 11, and have been playing ever since. I played in two bands in high school, performed with a live band/ensemble for a theatrical production of <i>"Hair! The Musical"</i> at the end of my senior year in high school, and currently play loosely with a group of friends in other friends' livingrooms and backyards. </li>
    <br>
    <li> I consider myself to be a pretty athletic person, but skateboarding is my athletic pursuit of choice. I had a small part in a skateboarding video premier at Grace Street Theater in Winter 2022. </li>
    <br>
    <li> I love history, geology, and astronomy. I enjoy collecting cool rocks that I have personally un-earthed. I have a moderately-decent telescope that I love to use on nights when the moon is bright, or when a certain planet is visible in the sky. I also collect trading cards of all sorts; old pre-1940's cigarette cards, baseball, basketball, Pokemon, and Yu-gi-ho cards! </li>
    <br>
    <li> I love cooking on my cast-iron skillet. It has serviced me for the last 5 years, and I take pride in maintaining it all this time. </li>
    <br>
    <li> My music taste is incredibly broad and obscure; not consistent in the slightest. I am hoping to begin a temporary career in radio as a DJ at WRIR 97.3 FM this fall/winter.
    </li>
